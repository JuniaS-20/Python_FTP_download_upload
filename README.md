# Python_FTP_download_upload
Python functions for downloading or uploading files to an ftp server

Data can easily be retrieved manually from an ftp server using tools such as FileZilla. However, you may have a lot of data to retrieve or send back to the ftp server. It can be efficient to automate these operations. 
This python script provides you with two functions for downloading or uploading files to an ftp server.

All you have to do is adapt it to your needs.  Best of all, if downloading/uploading data is a recurring operation for you, you can make it completely autonomous by inserting this script into a scheduler.
